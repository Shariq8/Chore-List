# TO DO LIST
This todolist is made via PHP and SQL. It contains a registration/login system in which users may enter their details and login.
They are able to enter chores they would like to do, set a frequency of the chore or a deadline of when it is due. It is an efficient and 
robust system which allows the user to be continually informed on when they have chores due. The data entered by a user is stored in a database.
Common security practicies have been caried out, such as serialisation of input strings, POST methods, hashing passwords, which produces a simple yet robust system.
